# Encapsulation- it is the concept of building data(variable) and method (function)
# that operate on that data within a single class,while direct acess to some object component
# self.owner=owner
# self.__balance=balance  double underscore means it is not directly acess
# from outside the class
# class Account:
#     def __init__(self,owner,balance):
#         self.owner=owner #public attribute
#         self.__balance=balance # double underscore use for private

#         def deposit(self,amount):
#             if amount >0:
#               self.__balance +=amount

#         def withdraw(self,amount):
#             if 0< amount <= self.__balance:
#                 self.__balance -=amount

#         def get_balance(self):
#             return self.__balance

# polymorphism 
# it is the ability for different object types to respond to the same method or
# function call in way specific to their class
# class Dog:
#     def speak(self):
#         return "woof"

# class Cat:
#     def speak(self):
#         return "meow"

# animals=[Dog(),Cat()]

# for animal in animals:
# print(animal.speak())
