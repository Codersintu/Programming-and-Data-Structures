# Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree which have of most one different b/w subtree
# height for each node in the tree

# complete Binary tree;it have all levels full of node,except the last level,which can also be full or filled from left to right 

# full binary tree: a kind of tree where each node has either 0 or 2child node

# binary tree-traversal:going through a tree by visiting every day node,one node at a time is called traversal
# (1)BFS-Breath first search==in BFS on the same level are visited before going
# to  the next level in the tree

# (2)DFS-defth first search==in this traversal moves down the tree all the way 
# dfs three types
# (1)pre-order
# (2)in-order
# (3)post-order
